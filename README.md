## Project Overview

The Titanic Survivors Analysis project aims to explore the Titanic dataset, identifying the key factors that affected passenger survival rates. Through various data cleaning, visualization, and machine learning techniques, we attempt to draw insights from the data.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset, which is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data). It includes information about the passengers on the Titanic, such as their age, gender, class, and whether or not they survived.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Titanic-Survivors-Analysis.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Titanic-Survivors-Analysis
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

   > Note: Make sure you have Python and pip installed on your system. The `requirements.txt` file should include necessary packages like `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `scikit-learn`.

## Usage

To run the analysis, open the `Titanic_Survivors.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter:

1. Start Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
2. Open `Titanic_Survivors.ipynb`.
3. Run the cells in the notebook to see the analysis and results.

## Analysis

The analysis in the notebook covers the following steps:

1. **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing data and encoding categorical variables.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing the data to understand the distribution and relationships between variables.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features that may improve the performance of machine learning models.
4. **Modeling:** Applying machine learning algorithms to predict survival and evaluate model performance.
5. **Conclusion:** Summarizing the findings and key insights from the analysis.

## Results

The key findings of the analysis include:

- [Summarize your main findings here, e.g., "Passengers in the first class had a significantly higher chance of survival."]
- [Include any interesting insights or model performance metrics.]
